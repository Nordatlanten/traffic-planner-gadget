# Backend side of project
To run this project:

```bash
npm run start
```

The environment checker will look for a `.env` file in `backend/`. If it does not already exist, you will be prompted by the checker to setup a new one. You will need to provide an `AUTH_KEY` which you can create at https://developer.vasttrafik.se.

This backend project is still a WIP, currently made for the sole purpose of learning Typescript.

## Planned additions
* Database management using Prisma
* User account CRUD.
